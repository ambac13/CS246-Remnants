Other Info:<br>
This project was done for <b>CS246</b> at <b>BYU-I</b>. To be able to create this program in the time allocated we will start with the original code for Bludbourne. Some of the planned changes include new menus, a new party system, and battle UI.

More Info:<br>
This project was created using the libgdx library. Found <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">here</a>.<br>
Mastering LibGDX Game Development by Patrick Hoey was a big help in this. Find his book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/mastering-libgdx-game-development">here</a>. <br>
This project started with code from Bludbourne and several classes were changed, created and modified. The BludBourne code, in all of it's originality can be found on Patrick Hoey's GitHub <a href="https://github.com/patrickhoey/BludBourne">here</a> Bludbourne is open source as indicated on page 418 of Mastering LibGDX GameDevelopment.
